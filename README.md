### Additional Information

> This version allows you to use SASS but is not required, you can still use traditional CSS. For a guide on how to use SASS <a href="https://sass-lang.com/guide" target="_blank">SEE HERE</a>
>
> In this version there is no `index.html` file located in the `dist` folder. The `index.html` file is now generated by webpack. To make changes to the `index.html` file that is generated see the configuration located at the bottom of `webpack.common.js`. The object passed into `HtmlWebpackPlugin` determines the content of the `index.html` file.
